Label Column:       label
AutoGluon infers your prediction problem is: 'multiclass' (because dtype of label-column == object).
	3 unique label values:  ['Exc L2-3 LINC00507 FREM3 superficial', 'Exc L2 LAMP5 LTK', 'Exc L2-4 LINC00507 GLP2R']
	If 'multiclass' is not the correct problem_type, please manually specify the problem_type parameter during Predictor init (You may specify problem_type as one of: ['binary', 'multiclass', 'regression', 'quantile'])
Problem Type:       multiclass
